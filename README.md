### üöÄInstallation and Directory Structure

1. **Upload files to Google Colab:**
    - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    - Click on **File** > **Upload notebook** and upload the `.ipynb` file from the `/KNN`, `/SVM`, or `/Decision_Trees` folders.
    - Upload the corresponding `.csv` file from your `/data` folder by using the following code in Colab:
     

2. **Adjust file paths:**
    - After uploading, use the filename directly if the file was uploaded to the Colab environment.
    

3. **Run the code**: Execute the notebook cells one by one to run the model.


- `/data`: Contains all the CSV files used in the project.
- `/KNN and SVM`: Jupyter notebooks related to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and  Vector Machines (SVM) model.
- `/Decision Trees`: Jupyter notebooks related to Decision Trees model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Pre-processing

- **Libraries Used:**  
  The necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `seaborn` were imported for data manipulation and visualization.

- **Data Import:**  
  The dataset for stock prices (e.g., INFY) was imported using `pandas`.

- **Correlation Analysis:**  
  Correlation between different columns was calculated, and a heatmap was plotted to visualize the correlation matrix.

- **Data Preparation:**  
  The last 72 hours of data were removed, and future close values were predicted.
